üöß **React Storefront POC for Sylius**

This is a proof-of-concept for a modern Sylius storefront built with React.  
The goal? To explore how far we can push the experience, performance, and flexibility of a headless Sylius shop with a fully custom frontend.

We‚Äôve focused on rapid prototyping, identifying key integration challenges, and laying the groundwork for a production-ready solution.  
Powered by curiosity, driven by real-world use cases. Ready for the next step.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This is an experimental project and not production-ready. Use it for learning, exploration, and as a base for further development.
